Although melanomas represent fewer than 5% of all skin cancers in the United States, they account for approximately 
75% of all skin-cancer-related deaths, and are responsible for over 10,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. 
Early detection is critical, as the estimated 5-year survival rate for melanoma drops from over 99% if detected
in its earliest stages to about 14% if detected in its latest stages.

The authoritative (Gold Standard) article regarding the achievement of Dermatoligist/Medical Expert level classification of 
skin cancer is the 2017 Nature article below:

Much work has been done in the open source community regarding skin cancer detection and screening.
There are 75 repositories and nearly 95k available code results on Github for "Skin Cancer Detection." 
Many of these projects are extremely useful to data scientists, physicians, and healthcare researchers, but have
little utility for patients, especially given the fact that there is very low health literacy in the 
United States.  Just 12 percent of American adults are health literate at a level that allows them to manage their
care, the latest News and Numbers statement from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) showed. 
The AHRQ release is based on information from the 2007 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report, 
which found that the majority of Americans lacked the skills required to correctly complete health care-related 
activities like reading a prescription bottle, figuring out medication dosage, filling out forms or calculating 
insurance coverage. That lack of literacy can negatively affect the quality of care a patient receives and costs
the U.S. economy up to $236 billion annually.

The Accenture / School of AI HealthHack is a 24 hour hackathon that focused on 4 challenges, including a Skin Cancer
Dataset.  The HealthHack Jawn team from Philadelphia decided to utilize the Skin Cancer Dataset as a foundation for 
an application that would provide Skin Cancer Detection Feedback for Everyone, while creating a gamification
activity that could educate children about the dangers of skin cancer and help in detection and classification at a 
elementary level, utilizing emojis and images that relate to kids.

Everyone is familiar with the way Geico cerated the Gekko and turned the stogy industry of insurance into something 
that is enjoyable and entertaining, at least in commercials. 

This application utilizes data and the model from the "ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection" 
as its foundation. Furthermore, "the  International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Archive contains over 13,000 
dermoscopic images, which were collected from clinical centers internationally and acquired from a variety of devices
within each center."

"The incidence of melanoma is higher in the Caucasian population, a July 2016 study in the Journal of the American Academy 
of Dermatology showed it is more deadly in people of color. African American patients were most likely to be diagnosed
with melanoma in its later stages than any other group in the study, and they also had the worst prognosis and the 
lowest overall survival rate." (skincancer.org)  Furthemore, in the United States it is becoming increasingly clear that
health literacy and knowledge must occur at a level where children are educated and understand as much about healthy
behaviours at a young age.   By joining with their parents and family members in healthcare discovery and knowledge, children
will become better healthcare consmuming adults to navigate the $3.5 trillion healthcare economy in the United States.

The HealthHack Jawn Team has created an app that we call Sherlock AI which teaches children about skin cancer and allows 
them to help their adult family members to take pictures of skin lesions that may or may not be cancerous.  Feedback is 
provided for adults about the potential risk and the children can utilize emojis and other images to identify what the 
lesions/moles look like in their own terms.  It is a fact that millions of Americans will go to the shores, mountains, or lakes
for vacations in the summer. In addition to playful activities, parents can engage their kids in a discussion about the
importance of preventitive care.  Furthermore, these "playful activities" can increase in degree of difficulty as the child gets older
or more experienced with preventitive measures.

Game play focuses and controls our attention like the Pokemon Go rage, it taps into our innate strengths, thrills, and compels us to
be better and more effective skills. That’s why many believe it is perfect to change our behavior in healthcare.  Gamified services will
engage us, and motivate us in ways that other incentives do not.  In fact gamification in healthcare is growing at a rate of 
20% per year and is expected to top $5 billion in 2022.   
 

In many cases when an adult is assessing a lesion, spot, or mole on their bodies, it's the result of what has been viewed in a mirror or what can be
seen on their hands and body in a mirror.  People rarely know what type of lesions or spots are on their backs unless inspected
by relatives or friends.   By initiating a gamification strategy as part of a detection regimen for skin cancer, children and grandchildren
can learn to be active members in preventative health strategies.
