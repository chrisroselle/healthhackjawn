There are 75 repositories and nearly 95k available code results on Github for "Skin Cancer Detection." 
Many of these projects are extremely useful to data scientists, physicians, and healthcare researchers, but have
little utility for patients, especially given the fact that there is very low health literacy in the 
United States.  Just 12 percent of American adults are health literate at a level that allows them to manage their
care, the latest News and Numbers statement from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) showed. 
The AHRQ release is based on information from the 2007 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report, 
which found that the majority of Americans lacked the skills required to correctly complete health care-related 
activities like reading a prescription bottle, figuring out medication dosage, filling out forms or calculating 
insurance coverage. That lack of literacy can negatively affect the quality of care a patient receives and costs
the U.S. economy between $106 billion and $236 billion annually

The Accenture / School of AI HealthHack is a 24 hour hackathon that focused on 4 challenges, including a Skin Cancer
Dataset.  The HealthHack Jawn team from Philadelphia decided to utilize the Skin Cancer Dataset as a foundation for 
an application that would provide Skin Cancer Detection Feedback for Everyone, while creating a gamification
activity that could educate children about the dangers of skin cancer and help in detection and classification at a 
elementary level, utilizing emojis. 

This application utilizes data and the model from the "ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection" 
as its foundation. Furthermore, "the  International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Archive contains over 13,000 
dermoscopic images, which were collected from clinical centers internationally and acquired from a variety of devices
within each center."

"The incidence of melanoma is higher in the Caucasian population, a July 2016 study in the Journal of the American Academy 
of Dermatology showed it is more deadly in people of color. African American patients were most likely to be diagnosed
with melanoma in its later stages than any other group in the study, and they also had the worst prognosis and the 
lowest overall survival rate." (skincancer.org)  Furthemore, in the United States it is becoming increasingly clear that
health literacy and knowledge must occur at a level where children are educated and understand the negative health effects of unhealthy food, 
water, air, climate change, and the consequences, including skin cancer. 

The HealthHack Jawn Team has created an app that teaches children about skin cancer and allows them to help their adult family
members to take pictures of skin lesions that may or may not be cancerous.  Feedback is provided for adults about the potential risk
and the children can utilize emojis and other images to identify what the lesions/moles look like in their own terms.  It is a 
fact that millions of Americans will go to the shores, mountains, or lakes for vacations in the summer.  In many cases when an
adult is assessing a lesion, spot, or mole on their bodies, it's the result of what has been viewed in a mirror or what can be
seen on their hands and body in a mirror.  People rarely know what type of lesions or spots are on their backs unless inspected
by relatives or friends.
