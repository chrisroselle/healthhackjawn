HealthHackJawn - Detecting Melanoma with Artificial Intelligence 

Skin cancer being one of the most common cancer diseases with high mortality rates, is an ideal use case for Artificial Intelligence. With Machine Learning algorithm on previously analyzed images, an application is built for quick screening and analysis for early detection of melanoma.

There are 75 repositories and nearly 95k available code results on Github for "Skin Cancer Detection." Many of these projects are extremely useful to data scientists, physicians, and healthcare researchers, but have little utility for patients, especially given the fact that there is very low health literacy in the United States.

HealthHackJawn's application utilizes data and the model from the "ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection" as its foundation. Furthermore, "the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Archive contains over 13,000 dermoscopic images, which were collected from clinical centers internationally and acquired from a variety of devices within each center."
